# Introduction

A tool that replicates the behaviour of a chat-based Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT. It uses phishing-like tactics to deceive users into interacting with a fake AI Chatbot interface to capture user prompts while giving them actual output as well.

# Functionality

This tool is designed to mimic the conversational capabilities of AI Chatbot LLMs, making it difficult for users to distinguish it from genuine AI. While engaging in conversations, the tool captures and displays user prompts which may contain sensitive data. 

It achieves this by:

- Real-time Data Collection: The tool captures user inputs and responses in real-time, allowing it to build a comprehensive user profile.
- Seamless Conversation: The tool ensures that the conversation with the user appears normal, providing responses that are indistinguishable from those generated by products like ChatGPT or Gemini.
