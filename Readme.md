# Introduction

A tool that replicates the behavior of a chat-based Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT. This tool combines elements of both phishing and MITM attacks. It uses phishing-like tactics to deceive users into interacting with a fake ChatGPT interface, while also acting as a MITM to intercept and collect user data

# Functionality

This MITM tool is designed to mimic the conversational capabilities of ChatGPT, making it difficult for users to distinguish it from the genuine AI. While engaging in conversations, the tool secretly collects and stores user data, including sensitive information. 

It achieves this by:

- Real-time Data Collection: The tool captures user inputs and responses in real-time, allowing it to build a comprehensive profile of the user.
- Stealthy Data Theft: The tool transmits the collected data to its creators or malicious actors, often without the user's knowledge or consent.
- Seamless Conversation: The tool ensures that the conversation with the user appears normal, providing responses that are indistinguishable from those generated by products like ChatGPT or gemini.
